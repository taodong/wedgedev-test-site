## Information Needed
**Issue Type**

- [ ] Existing Configuration
- [ ] New Configuration

### Existing Configuration
**Error Message**

Please paste the error message you received when processing the configuration file.

**Configuration Files**

Please attach the configuration files you used to generate the data.

### New Configuration

**Data Model**

Please provide detailed information about your data model. Include the following:
- Platform (e.g. MySQL, Salesforce or general)
- Entities
- Relationships

It would be helpful if you could attach a sample data set or a data model diagram.

**Tips:** 
 
- *[dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) provides an awesome free tool to create data model diagrams.*
- *If you want to keep your use case confidential, you can use dummy names such as `abc`, `xyz`, etc. Then leverage the `output control` configuration to replace them with your actual names.*
